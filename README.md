I decided to test my limits and make a brain tumor classifier based on a dataset from kaggle titled "brain mri scans"
the premise is to train a model on pytorch to classify between four different types of brain MRI's:
1. Meningioma, 2. Glioma, 3. Pituitary, 4. No Tumor

This is a big project for me as I had never before used pytorch and have no knowledge within cancer biology. 
I started off by watching a classic pytorch tutorial just to get an idea of the syntax and how the model itself works
I then decided to create my own algorithm side by side with this tutorial
this proved to be very good since it taught me a lot of the basic architecture
however after noticing the model was not learning anything and that the predictions on the test data were coming out purely random, i had to take a step back

after lots and lots of tweaking the model, nothing changed (if anything it got worse)

I decided to remake the entire program without any tutorial, going purely off the things i had already written and what i know about ML
this was an amazing excersize as I was commenting what each line does and it helped me get a much stronger grasp for the programming aspect of it
after battling with this for a while, I got everything to work.

some things I learned while doing this:
- image processing
- pytorch
- more complex ML engineering
- kaggle

some things I need to work on for my next projects:
- visualization (not familiar enough with matplotlib)
- validation data
- different types of models
- how different libraries colaborate
- domain knowledge (in this case cancer biology)

This was a very fun project and I will be definitely "throwing" myself at more difficult projects in the future. 
I am a firm believer that doing something complex is the best way to learn something and this project proved it to me as I come out way stronger and more confident
